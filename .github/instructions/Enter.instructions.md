## Repository guidelines

- Do not add test files or new Markdown documentation unless specifically requested.
- After generating code, run Pylance (VS Code Problems) and prioritize resolving any high-severity issues before proceeding or committing.
- Recommended workflow:
    1. Generate code
    2. Run Pylance and linters
    3. Fix critical/high-priority issues
    4. Commit changes
- If you need help, include the exact Pylance error messages when requesting support.
